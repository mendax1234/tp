## Overview

ModHero is a CLI-first desktop app for planning your university degree, designed to give you the speed and precision of
command-line input while retaining the clarity of a graphical overview. ModHero helps you build and adapt your 4-year
course roadmap more efficiently than traditional spreadsheet or browser-based tools.

- Enhancements implemented:
    - I worked on the AddCommand, DeleteCommand, MajorCommand, ScheduleCommand, Constants, MajorData, PrereqGraph,
      Timetable and Parser to ensure that the first iteration of the timetable being loaded is working
    - I improved the user story and user journey as a whole, reimagining how a user would intuitively use our ModHero
      product from start to finish
    - I improved all the UI (Welcome message, helpCommand, Timetable UI) to ensure that the User Interface and User
      Experience is as intuitive and as easy to follow as possible

    - During one of our iterations, I paused our team and suggested that we start from first principles and not
      lose sight of the big picture. We were just adding features and were very confused as to what each other are doing
      and the direction of our project is, so I created this pdf to imagine how a user will use our app, and also adding
      the detail that users probably would want to first generate the timetable to **see** their timetable because we 
      humans want visual feedback and interaction as opposed to pure instruction following,
    - This then had a downstream effect in how we write out welcome message, help message and also our other features 
      and commands
- Review/mentoring contributions:
    - Actively reviewed other members’ pull requests and provided constructive feedback.
    - Added and managed issue and PR labels, ensuring traceability of progress.
    - Created and maintained milestones to align with the project schedule
- Contribution beyond the project team:
    - Review of other teams DeveloperGuide during tutorial
    - Report bugs in Practical Exam Dry run
