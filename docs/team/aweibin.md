## Overview
ModHero is a CLI-first desktop app for planning your university degree (CEG and CS), designed to give you the speed and precision of command-line input while retaining the clarity of a graphical overview. ModHero helps you build and adapt your 4-year course roadmap more efficiently than traditional spreadsheet or browser-based tools.

- Try to work on something every week and achieve a commit rate of at least 250 codes a week in a span of 7 weeks

### Enhancement Implemented:
- Created class outline for basic user commands based on User Stories
- Parser to match the user command and converts into validate arguments
- Serialiser and deserialiser that handles string robustly without getting affected by symbols
- Algorithm to store/retrieve module/major data from hashmap
- Storage with ModuleStorage and SaveStorage
- Assertion at functions that requires data to be validated before passing in
- Logging placed along the program flow
- Retrieve information from NUSMods
- Parse JSON string into Module object
- Cartesian prerequisite to achieve easy checking of prerequisite while adding to timetable
- Junit test for NUSMods related component
- Junit test for SaveStorage
- Convert preloaded resource file into JAR for better security
- Exemption list
- Simplify save file format to allow advance user to edit
- FIx PED bugs

### Contribution to UG:
- Worked with TG and produce the first UserGuide draft
- Added examples with expected output
- Final proofread

### Contribution to DG:
- Storage Component
- Parser Component
- Manual testing
- Final proofread

### Contribution to team-based tasks:
- Necessary general code enhancements
- Maintaining the issue tracker
- Release v1.0 and v2.0
- Updating user/developer docs that are not specific to a feature e.g., documenting the target user profile
- Incorporating more useful tools/libraries/frameworks into the product or the project workflow (e.g. automate more aspects of the project workflow using a GitHub plugin)

### Review/mentoring contributions:
- Discord call to demonstrate implementing of algorithm unclear to others
- Face to face mentoring to resolve git related issues

### Contributions beyond the project team:
- Review of other teams DeveloperGuide during tutorial
- Report bugs in Practical Exam Dry run
