## Overview

ModHero is a CLI-first desktop app for planning your university degree, designed to give you the speed and precision of
command-line input while retaining the clarity of a graphical overview. ModHero helps you build and adapt your 4-year
course roadmap more efficiently than traditional spreadsheet or browser-based tools.
