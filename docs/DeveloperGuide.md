Concepts, diagram formats, and document structure have been adapted from it for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

## Design & Implementation
This section describes the overall design of **ModHero**, followed by explanations of each major component.  
It serves as a roadmap for future developers to understand how the system is structured, how the components interact, and how each part fulfills its role.

### High-Level Architecture
<figure align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/HighLevelArchitecture.png" alt="High Level Architecture Diagram" />
  <figcaption><em>High-Level Architecture Diagram of ModHero</em></figcaption>
</figure>

The **ModHero** architecture follows a modular structure inspired by AddressBook-Level3. It comprises four main components:
- **UI** -- Handles user interaction and display.
- **Logic** — Parses and executes user commands.
- **Model** — Maintains in-memory data (modules, majors, timetable).
- **Storage** — Manages persistent data on disk.

At launch, `Main` initializes these components and connects them.  
At shutdown, it ensures all data is saved correctly to persistent storage.

### Logic Component
<figure align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ParserUML.png" alt="Parser Class Diagram" style="width:100%; height:auto;" />
    <figcaption><em>UML class diagram showing relationships within the Parser component.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

### Model Component
**API:** `Model.java`

The **Model component** is responsible for managing all in-memory data of ModHero.  
It encapsulates the application’s state — including modules, majors, prerequisites, and the user’s 4-year timetable — and provides APIs for other components to access or modify this data safely.

It resides in the package `modhero.data` and its sub-packages:
- `modhero.data.major`
- `modhero.data.modules`
- `modhero.data.timetable`

#### UML Structure
<figure align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png" alt="Model Class Diagram" />
  <figcaption><em>UML class diagram showing relationships within the Model component.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Key Responsibilities
- **DataManager** – Central data coordinator that loads, stores, and provides access to model entities.
- **Timetable** – Maintains the 4-year plan, organizing modules by year and semester.
- **Module** – Represents an individual module with code, name, MCs, and prerequisite structure.
- **ModuleList** – Groups modules logically (e.g., core or elective).
- **Prerequisites** – Captures module prerequisites as nested lists.
- **MajorData** – Defines core module sets for each supported major.
- **TimetableModule** – Extends `Module` by adding `year` and `term` fields to specify when a module is taken.

#### Design Rationale
- **Inheritance:** `TimetableModule` *is-a* `Module`, enriched with temporal (year, term) information.
- **Composition:** `DataManager` *has-a* `Timetable`, `ModuleList`, and `Prerequisites` — they exist only while `DataManager` exists.
- **Aggregation:** Modules and majors can exist independently and are aggregated under `DataManager`.

This separation allows the Model to remain cohesive yet modular, enabling clean integration with other components such as Storage and Logic.

### Storage Component
<figure align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/StorageUML.png" alt="Storage Class Diagram" style="width:100%; height:auto;" />
    <figcaption><em>UML class diagram showing relationships within the Storage component.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

The `Storage` component is responsible for loading and saving essential application data.
It reads text files from predefined directories and converts their contents into a structured, accessible format for other components to process.

Three primary classes, `ModuleStorage`, `MajorStorage` and `SaveStorage`, rely on `Storage` to retrieve module and major data to construct the timetable.

`SaveStorage` stores the user timetable data and exempted modules. It is store in a simple format to allow user to edit it quickly.
The data is loaded everytime the application starts a fresh run and saved when 'schedule' command is given.
The format of the save file is:
```
Timetable data
CG1111A|1|1
Exempted Modules data
MA1301
```
The `Timetable data` and `Exempted Modules data` marks the starting of each section respectively.
Timetable format is `[module code]|[selected year]|[selected term]`

`ModuleStorage` and `MajorStorage` then deserialize the loaded text into objects such as Module, Major, and Prerequisites, which are stored in in-memory hash maps for efficient access.
The process is supported by two utility classes, `SerialisationUtil` and `DeserialisationUtil`, which enhance data conversion and validation.
Each text file is stored in a unique, well-defined format, ensuring accurate data retrieval without missing words or parsing errors.
Deserialization also serves as a validation step, confirming that the entire file has been successfully read and processed.
To maintain data integrity and readability, all resources data should be in serialized form, ensuring a consistent and reliable file structure for future loading operations.

#### Serialiser and Deserialiser

All resources data are stored in a serialised format following this convention `[content length][start delimiter][content][end delimiter]`.
This format ensures that any characters and symbols in the content will not be able to interfere with splitting the content into the correct component.
Furthermore, it is able to ensure that all the text required for the component has been read successfully without any data corruption.

It can be used to serialise a string or a one dimension list of strings. Deserialising it will return it back to it original list form.
Nested List can also be serialised by performing serialised on each dimension of the list and combining them together as a string.
It is also able to serialise objects with different data types. For example, the module data consist of module code and prerequisite which is in String and Nested List.
It can be serialised by performing serialised on each data type and combining them together.

A simple example.
Let the start delimiter be `#` and end delimiter be `|`
Information to be saved:
- Module Code (String): `CS2113`
- Description (String): `Algorithmic proof: An infinite set has a countably infinite subset.`
- Prerequisites (List): `[MA1301X,MA1301]`

Serialised output:
- Module Code (String): `6#CS2113|`
- Description (String): `67#Algorithmic proof: An infinite set has a countably infinite subset.|`
- Prerequisites (String): `19#7#MA1301X|6#MA1301||`

Saved in text file: `6#CS2113|67#Algorithmic proof: An infinite set has a countably infinite subset.|19#7#MA1301X|6#MA1301||`
Deserialising it will reconstruct the same data structure as the original.

### UI Component
<figure align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/UI_class_diagram.png" alt="Storage Class Diagram" />
    <figcaption><em>UML class diagram showing relation between UI object and Modhero.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

The UI component is responsible for all interactions between the user and the program. This includes being the point at which all user inputs are collected
and all outputs to the user are displayed through. All inputs are read by the ```readCommand``` method which trims the user input.
The output methods included in this class are the methods to show the welcome message, bye message, and the
feedback for executing any given command.


## Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Feature

#### Overview
The `add` feature allows users to add a module to their timetable in a specific year and semester.  The feature is encapsulated by the `AddCommand` class, which serves as the controller for this operation. It coordinates fetching module data (from a local cache `allModulesData` or the NUSMODS API) and then delegates the core logic of adding the module and checking business rules to the Timetable model.

#### Key Components
- **`AddCommand.java`**: The command class that parses the user's intent. Its `execute()` method orchestrates the entire "add" operation.
- **`Timetable.java`**: The data model representing the user's timetable. It is responsible for all business logic, such as checking for duplicates, validating prerequisites (`checkModuleAddable`), and storing the module (`addModuleInternal`).
- **`ModuleRetriever.java`**: A utility class used by `AddCommand` to fetch module details from the external NUSMODS API if the module isn't found in the local `allModulesData` cache.
- **`allModulesData` (Map)**: A map that acts as a local cache for module data to minimize API calls.

#### Sequence Diagram
This diagram illustrates the typical flow for adding a module that is *not* yet in the local cache (`allModulesData`) but *is* found in the NUSMODS API, and for which the user *meets* the prerequisites.

<figure align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/addCommand.png" alt="Add Command Sequence Diagram" />
    <figcaption><em>Add Command Sequence Diagram</em></figcaption>
</figure>


#### Detailed Execution Flow
1.  **Initiation**: The `execute()` method of `AddCommand` is called.
2.  **Cache Check**: It first attempts to get the `Module` object from the local `allModulesData` cache.
3.  **API Fallback (Optional)**:
    * If the module is `null` (not in the cache), the command enters an **`opt`** (optional) fragment.
    * It calls `getModule()` on the `ModuleRetriever`.
    * **`alt` [Module Not Found]**: If the retriever returns `null`, a `ModuleNotFoundException` is thrown, caught by `AddCommand`, and returned as an error `CommandResult`.
    * **`else` [Module Found]**: If the retriever returns a valid `Module` object, it is saved to the `allModulesData` cache for future use.
4.  **Timetable Delegation**: The `AddCommand` calls `timetable.addModule()` with the `Module` object and target location.
5.  **Business Logic Validation**:
    * Inside `timetable.addModule()`, the first step is to call its own `checkModuleAddable()` method.
    * This check performs two key validations:
        1.  **Duplicate Check**: It calls `getAllModules()` to see if the module code already exists in the timetable.
        2.  **Prerequisite Check**: It calls `getModulesTakenUpTo()` to get a list of all modules taken before or during the target semester. It then gets the `Prerequisites` from the `module` and checks if the list of completed modules satisfies any of the prerequisite options.
6.  **Handling Validation Result**:
    * **`alt` [Checks Fail]**: If the module already exists or prerequisites are not met, `checkModuleAddable()` throws a `ModHeroException` (e.g., `ModuleAlreadyExistsException`, `PrerequisiteNotMetException`).
    * This exception propagates up to `AddCommand`, which catches it and returns a `CommandResult` with the error message.
    * **`else` [Checks Pass]**: If all checks pass, `timetable.addModule()` proceeds.
7.  **Final Add**: The method calls `addModuleInternal()`, which performs the simple action of adding the `Module` object to the correct `ArrayList` in the `timetable` data structure.
8.  **Success Result**: `AddCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` with a success message and returns it to the caller.

### Delete Feature
#### Overview
The ```Delete``` feature allows the user to delete a given module from the timetable while making sure
that it doesn't affect the prerequisites for one of the other modules in the timetable. The expected arguments taken in
by the delete command is the module the user wants to delete and the feedback to the user is confirmation of the delete or
if the delete failed, the reason why the module could not be deleted.
The details about how to use the feature are in the user guide.

#### Sequence Diagram
<figure align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/Delete_sequence_diagram.png" alt="Add Command Sequence Diagram" />
    <figcaption><em>Delete Command Sequence Diagram</em></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Execution Flow of the Delete Command
1. The Delete feature is encapsulated in the `DeleteCommand` Class, which is instantiated by the parser when the user
   inputs the delete command
2. The Constructor for the Delete command parses the list and stores the list of modules slated to be deleted by the user.
   If any of the module codes contain lower case letters it capitalises them so that the timetable can recognise them.
3. When the `execute()` method of the `DeleteCommand` is called, command calls the internal `deleteModule` method from the `Timetable`
   object for each of the modules
4. The timetable silently deletes all the specified modules and only throws an exception if the module specified does not
   exist in the timetable or is a prerequisite to another module in the timetable.
5. Modules that could not be deleted due to prerequisites or not being in the Timetable is stored in a separate list, and
   the modules that could and couldn't be deleted with their reason are turned into a string and used to instantiate a command
   which is then returned to be displayed to the user by the UI.

#### Internal Details of the `deleteModule` method of the Timetable object
1. The `deleteModule` method takes only the module to be deleted as the input
2. The method then calls the `findModuleLocation` method to get the year and semester in which the module is located. If
   the module does not exist in the timetable, a `ModuleNotFound` exception is thrown
3. Then the `checkPrerequisitesSatisfiedAfterDelete` method is called to check whether the user is deleting a prerequisite
   to another module in the timetable. This method is silently executed and returns nothing. Only if it detects a module for
   which the prerequisite is being violated, it throws a PrerequisiteNotMet exception and cancels the delete operation.
4. Given that the module exists in the timetable and deleting it does not affect another module's prerequisites, it now
   deletes the module.

#### Error Handling
Error handling is centralized within the `execute()` method of `AddCommand`. A `try-catch` block wraps the entire logic.

- Any `ModHeroException` (e.g., `InvalidYearOrSemException`, `ModuleNotFoundException`, `ModuleAlreadyExistsException`,`PrerequisiteNotMetException`) thrown by `Timetable` or `ModuleRetriever` is caught.
- The exception's message (`e.getMessage()`) is used to create a new `CommandResult`, ensuring that the user receives a clean, specific error message without crashing the application.
- A general `Exception` catch block also exists to handle any unexpected errors, logging them and returning a generic error message.

### Major feature
#### Overview
The Major feature allows users to declare their university major (e.g. Computer Science or Computer Engineering) using the major command.

#### Sequence Diagram
The following two diagrams illustrate how modules are added to the timetable when the user declares a major.

<figure align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/majorCommand.png" alt="Major Command Sequence Diagram" />
    <figcaption><em>Major Command Sequence Diagram</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<figure align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/majorCommand-GetModuleFromMajorObject.png" alt="Get Module From Major Object Sequence Diagram" width="70%" />
    <figcaption><em>Get Module From Major Object Sequence Diagram</em></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Execution flow of the Major Command
1. The user types a command such as major cs.
2. Parser identifies the command word major and creates a MajorCommand object with the argument "cs".
3. When execute() is called, the MajorCommand retrieves the matching Major object from the pre-loaded hashmap in Storage.
4. The command clears the current core module list (if any) and fills it with the modules listed in the Major object.
5. UI then displays “Reset to default Timetable for Major in (major)."

#### Internal Details
- We only allow users to declare their major as CS or CEG because the prerequisites for the other majors are not included in our major.txt preloaded data file.
- You can update major.txt to add a new major. (For the serialised data format, please go to the [Serialiser](#serialiser) section for the details)

#### Error Handling
- If the user provides an invalid or unknown major short code (e.g. major ISE), the program returns an error message: "Sorry, [major] is not supported. Try 'CS' or 'CEG'."
